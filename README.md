# Sharks



## 1. Introduction


- This case is going to study the attacks of sharks on humans since we have a record of it. 
- The case will explore different hypotheses and try to prove them by analyzing the data provided.
- The study is using a data set which at first is very messy and will try to clean it as much as possible to test the hypotheses.

## 2. Hypotheses

1. First Hypothesis: Sharks prefer legs before arms, they are more tasty.
2. Second Hypothesis: What is the sharks type? Or who is the most likely to receive a shark bite (age, gender, country).
3. Third Hypothesis: We have had more shark attacks in the past 50 years than in the rest of recorded attacks in history.
