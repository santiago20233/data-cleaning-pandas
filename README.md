# Sharks



## 1. Introduction


- This case is going to study the attacks of sharks on humans since we have a record of it. 
- The case will explore different hypotheses and try to prove them by analyzing the data provided.
- The study is using a data set which at first is very messy and will try to clean it as much as possible to test the hypotheses.

## 2. Hypotheses

1. First Hypothesis: Sharks prefer legs before arms, they are more tasty.
2. Second Hypothesis: What is the sharks type? Or who is the most likely to receive a shark bite (age, gender, country).
3. Third Hypothesis: We have had more shark attacks in the past 50 years than in the rest of recorded attacks in history.

## 3. First steps, importing and cleaning

After importing the data, the first filter was made by counting the number of null values in each row. In this step the data set was reduced from 25723 to 6309.
Next, duplicates were removed, and useless columns that were not needed as well. Following that, adaptations were made to clean the columns and have more useful data for the analysis. After a clean dataset is achieved, the data set is exported as a CSV document called clean_sharks.csv

## 4. Next steps, analysing and proving hypotheses

The analysis consists in three parts, proving each one of the hypotheses to be right or wrong. 
After importing the clean dataset,
